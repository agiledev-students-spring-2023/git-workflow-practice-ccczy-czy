# Twitter in 2012 VS 2022
I found the article [Twitter Architecture 2022 vs 2012](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/twitter-architecture-2022-vs-2012) by Alex Xu very interesting. Alex uses two graphs to compare Twitter's architecture in 2012 and 2022. The article also touches on SSO, which is a service that we are using daily when we log into our Brightspace, Zoom, Gmail, etc. I think from this article gives me a snapshot of modern web apps' tech stacks and explains them in plain English without going too deep and making me feel lost.

I thought that this article did a good job explaining the differences between how twitter used to work in 2012 and how it works today. I was impressed with how the author was able to include detailed diagrams of how the API works. It's too bad that they are removing free access to the API! So sad.

This article was an interesting read!  I specifically liked the part on Code First v.s. API First software development philosophy, since it explains in depth why API first is greatly advantageous and preferred in the developer community.
